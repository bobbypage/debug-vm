======

This is a debug pod that will record system level metrics to stdout and to
the systemd log for offline analysis.

You can run this either as a one-shot command to test it out:

  kubectl run gcr.io/bowei-gke/debug-vm /run.sh -oneShot

or `kubectl apply -f deploy.yaml` to deploy a daemonset to your cluster. The
daemonset by default will only deploy on nodes with the label `debug-vm: true`,
so you must apply the label to have it run:

  kubectl label nodes/gke-xxxx debug-vm=true
